# Seinfeld text analysis using `R`

## Objectives
- **Sentiment analysis of Seinfeld scripts**
    - Positive and negative sentiments across different lexicons
- **Identify "catchpharses", common themes, and inside jokes**
    -  Word frequency and relationships
- **Word correlation**
    - How are certain words related?
- **Wrangle and visualize insightful relationships**...

## Methods
<!--- maybe break down by step and give brief summary, such as data wrangling with tidytext to seperate words grouped by "x" to investigate "y" --->
### The Data Workflow
- Seperate processes into dedicated `R` scripts and '*stages*':
    - Individual `R` file for each data prep / wrangling / cleaning task
    - Save wrangled and cleaned data frames as `.csv`'s
    - Load prepared data into dedicated visualization scripts
    - Save individual visuals and final visuals

**This workflow is done in stages for the following reasons:**
- Lighten the workload on a machine - *lots of text in these datasets*
- Maintain an organized work enviroment
- Prepared data can be saved and used in the future - *version control*
- Errors can be isolated
### Sentiment Analysis
1. `unnest_tokens()` - *Seperate text into rows of single words*
2. `anti_join()` - *Drop uninteresting words (stop words)*
3.  `get_sentiment()` - *Evaluating 3 different lexicons:*
    - Bing
    - NRC
    - AFINN
### Character Bigrams
> **Bigrams:** Pairs of consecutive words grouped by character with counts
1. `unnest_tokens(bigram)` - *Seperate text into rows of two words*
2. `filter()` - *Remove common stop words and selected words, keep only selected show characters*
3. `group_by()` - *Group by character and get counts of bigrams*
